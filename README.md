# Yocto Learning Journey

This repository tracks my learning journey with the **Yocto Project**, following the [Techleef YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Techleef).

## Lessons

### `lesson_hello_layer`

> This is a basic Yocto layer that contains a recipe with a locally created `hello.c` file.

### `lesson_hellofromgit_layer`

> This layer demonstrates how to:
> 
> - Fetch source files from a Git repository.
> - Manage recipe dependencies.
> - Use symbolic linking for a shared library:
>   - `soname`
>   - `realname`
>   - `linkername`
